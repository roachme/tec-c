Hi everyone. My first post ever. Ha-ha-ha.
I'd like to talk about task/project manager in terminal. I'm here to get feedback on my project. Positive or negative. Any kind'll help.

Usually I work on multiple tasks at the same time, gotta switch between 'em frequently, gotta store related repos, scripts, notes somewhere for each tasks and memorize bunch of task IDs. I got tired of it cuz it ain't my job to memorize these kinda stuff so I started a project - tman. I live in terminal and really like GNU/Unix philosophy O_o...
I know tons of task managers are out there, but I truly believe my project has some special in it.
1. It can be used for task managing
2. For project managing (include some plugins and there you go)
3. It is cstomizable and extendable (via plugins)
4. No interactive stuff. I don't want a user to learn new thing. Use it as commands: ls, mkdir, cd, etc.  
Project's available on Github tman. Please gimme feedback an on project, issues or features.
