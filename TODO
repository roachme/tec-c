Priorities:
  high - bugfix, hotfix and feature tasks.
  mid  - constant stuff like make it faster, smaller, etc.
  low  - when you get time

Ideas:
  1. Replace cat & ls hooks with reading from file. Gonna highly optimize
     command exection.
  2. Add multiple users.
  3. Add support for plugin to use libtman/tman commands.
  4. Add support to pass system config values via option to util.
  5. Add option to show task columns in command `tman list`.

Prio: high
+ 1. Write config file parser and define config itself.
  2. Find a good way to invoke hooks
  3. Find good structures for commands like list and cat.
+ 4. Use dynamic memory allocation so there'd be no limit on number of tasks in enviroment.
  5. Add a support for a user to add custom task columns.
+ 6. Add a good manual system.
  7. Plugin gun (for git repos) depends on system unit date. Outta create its own one.

Prio: mid
+ 1. Command `set' can't change task type.
  2. Add a style checker.
  3. Unify commands list and find.
  4. Add case-sensetive option to command list.

Prio: low
  1. Add command autocomplitions
  7. Fucking OPTIMIZED core commands. The latency should be <= 0.01 with 100 tasks
