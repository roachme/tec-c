Priorities:
  high - bugfix, hotfix and feature tasks.
  mid  - constant stuff like make it faster, smaller, etc.
  low  - when you get time

Bugs:
+ 1. Command `tman col prev <TASKID>` moves task to column 'prev' even if no current task ID is set.
  2. Command `tman move` can't move multiple task to another project.

Ideas:
  1. Replace cat & ls hooks with reading from file. Gonna highly optimize
     command exection.
  2. Add multiple users.
  3. Add support for plugin to use libtman/tman commands.
  4. Add support to pass system config values via option to util.
+ 5. Add option to show task columns in command `tman col`.

Prio: high
+ 1. Write config file parser and define config itself.
  2. Find a good way to invoke hooks
  3. Find good structures for commands like list and cat.
+ 4. Use dynamic memory allocation so there'd be no limit on number of tasks in enviroment.
  5. Add a support for a user to add custom task columns.
+ 6. Add a good manual system.
  7. Plugin gun (for git repos) depends on system unit date. Outta create its own one.
+ 8. tman_check_prj() does not fail if prj == NULL, tho it should.
  9. Add support to config file to parse $HOME in path. It'll be convient for a user.
 10. Add debug prints to commands. Pro'ly as option -v.


Prio: mid
+ 1. Command `set' can't change task type.
+ 2. Add a style checker.
  3. Unify commands list and find.
+ 4. Add case-sensetive option to command list.
  5. Delete function tman_id_find_by_desc(). Use tman_id_list() instead in cli.
? 6. Print PWD in /tmp/tmanpwd. Then shell part will it from there.
+ 7. In command `add`: if no ID provided then generate task ID.
+ 8. Why use tman_get_args() if tman_check_arg_id() get default values anyway?

Prio: low
  1. Add command autocomplitions
  7. Fucking OPTIMIZED core commands. The latency should be <= 0.01 with 100 tasks
