Priorities:
    high - bugfix, hotfix and feature tasks.
    mid  - constant stuff like make it faster, smaller, etc.
    low  - when you get time

Ideas:
    1. Replace cat & ls hooks with reading from file. Gonna highly optimize
       command exection.

Prio: high
1. Write config file parser and define config itself.
2. Find a good way to invoke hooks
3. Find good structures for commands like list and cat.
4. Use dynamic memory allocation so there'd be no limit on number of tasks in enviroment.
5. Add a support for a user to add custom task columns.
6. Add a good manual system.
7. Plugin gun (for git repos) should depend on system unit date.
   Outta create its own one.


Prio: low
1. Add command autocomplitions


7. Fucking OPTIMIZED core commands. The latency should be <= 0.01 with 100 tasks
