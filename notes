Requirements for task manager:
    1. There should be 4 builtin columns (like ninja-turtles:)
        a. todo
        b. curr
        c. prev
        .. custom columns
        .. custom columns
        .. custom columns
        d. done
    2. There should be builtin commands to move task to any of them (except for custom tho)

Qs:
    1. Should feature `prev` be builtin or moved to plugin `flow`?

As:
    1. Commands `prev` and `sync` are gonna be builtin commands. Cuz lots of other
       commands about bound to current task.


Usage: tman switch [OPTION]... [ID]...
   Move task to one of the builtin columns.

   Options:
     -b BRD  board name
     -c      column to move task to
     -h      show this help and exit
     -n      do not switch to task (only for column 'current')
     -p PRJ  project name
     -q      do not write anything to standard error output
     -N      neither switch to task nor to task directory (only for column 'current')
