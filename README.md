## ⇁  Problems
During my work I encounter many subtaks I gotta do on the daily basis.
Among them 
1. Clone Git repos to my machine and create branches in multiple repos (usually different for each task)
2. Keep my task logs, sketches, notes and repos for each task somewhere. Structured and seperately
3. Often switch between task, which involves context, notes, sketches, and especially Git branches

Tman comes with 3 basic ideas
1. Structure your workspace for each task
2. Get you exactly where you want with fewest keystrokes
3. Automate stuff that you're tired of during the work. Here plugins are for

## ⇁  Structure
